This is a personal academic website, currently under construction (as is hopefully obvious).

Brief academic bio
======

Pre-history
---
When I started a science degree at the University of Sydney in 1990, after taking a year off from study, I did not know which direction I would be taking, at that stage thinking that perhaps I might train as a vet.  But I had always loves maths, and discovered another joy in philosophy, and persevered with those to finish up with an honours degree in Pure Mathematics.  I followed one of my lecturers, Jie Du, to UNSW to do a PhD with him on Iwahori-Hecke algebras; a topic that linked very nicely with my honours work on braid groups at Sydney (with Jonathan Hillman).
