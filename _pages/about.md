This is a personal academic website, currently under construction (as is hopefully obvious).



Research
======

My research covers a broad range of areas; a result of following my nose and the opportunities to work with interesting people. I especially like using things I know about from algebra, such as finite reflection groups, to solve problems in other areas, such as biology and statistics.  But I also enjoy the challenge of solving problems by "whatever means necessary", whether the solutions end up using group theory or not.

I will post more of my research story elsewhere on this site.

Other interests
