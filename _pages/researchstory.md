Pre-history
---
When I started a science degree at the University of Sydney in 1990, after taking a year off from study, I did not know which direction I would be taking, at that stage thinking that perhaps I might train as a vet.  But I had always loved maths, and discovered another joy in philosophy, and persevered with those to finish up with an honours degree in Pure Mathematics.  I followed one of my lecturers, Jie Du, to UNSW to do a PhD with him on Iwahori-Hecke algebras; a topic that linked very nicely with my honours work on braid groups at Sydney (with Jonathan Hillman).

My thesis work on centres of Hecke algebras, submitted in early 1998, was enough to scrape me into a postdoc at the University of Virginia, working with Leonard Scott, where I spent two great years.  I was tremendously lucky then to land a tenure-track job at the young University of Western Sydney, and started there in mid-2000.

Western Sydney and the transition into biology

When I arrived at UWS, the university was only 11 years old, and the advertisement called for a Lecturer in Mathematics, within the Faculty of Management.  The job required teaching Discrete Mathematics and Mathematics for Business, and didn't mention research as I recall.  Nevertheless, research was a requirement for getting the job, and I was fortunate to have had a couple of papers in good pure maths journals, as well as some teaching at UVa, that together got me over the line.

I came back to Sydney and started work at Blacktown in the western suburbs.  Two things really shifted my trajectory within a couple of years of starting at UWS.  The first was that an old friend from undergrad days, Mark Tanaka, also returned to Sydney from a PhD and postdoc in the US.  The second was that UWS was able to hire some wonderful people and strong researchers in mathematics, and this, together with internal restructures that brought us together, began to shift the feel of UWS towards a stronger focus on research.

My transition from straight algebra to more applied work is due to Mark Tanaka.  I think the human, serendipitous aspect of science and academic life is deeply understood by many but not spoken of enough.  Or perhaps it is. What is enough?  But anyway, I started working on biology after Mark introduced me to a problem in epidemiology at a BBQ (and it wasn't about salmonella in the chicken kebabs).  Since then my research has branched into a range of programmes in biology, including genome organisation and phylogenetics alongside epidemiology, and I have also dabbled in statistical theory.
